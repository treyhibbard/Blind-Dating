Then, I’d be doing something engaging and fulfilling: whether it’s working toward my goals, modeling, traveling, or just something that puts me in my element.

In the afternoon, maybe something outdoors or active such as a great hike, exploring a new place, or something spontaneous that breaks the routine.

The day would end with good people, good food, and a feeling of accomplishment, whether that’s a great conversation, a fun social event, or just a moment to take everything in.","I wish people asked better and more intentional questions, not just small talk, but they framed them in a casual way, not in a super business-interview way. I like things that actually tell you something about the person, although there is always a balance to be found between small talk in the beginning and moving to deeper conversations over time. Here are some questions I’d actually enjoy being asked: 1. “What’s something you’ve learned about yourself recently?” 	2. “What kind of energy do you bring into a room?”	3. “What drives you? What keeps you going even when things get tough?”	4. “If we only had one night to hang out, what’s something you’d want to do?”",Yes,4:03,,,@jpmelitski11,9083344874,3,"Extraversion, Partner Interaction",Emotion,"April 1st - Monday, April 2nd - Tuesday, April 3rd - Wednesday, April 4th - Thursday, April 5th - Friday",Arriving right at 6:32pm.,"My ideal night depends on the vibe.

If it’s social: I’d want to be in a setting where I’m surrounded by great energy, maybe a bar or lounge with a good atmosphere. Somewhere that feels relaxed and fun. Sometimes I’m at my fraternity house too. 

If it’s more lowkey: A late-night drive with the right music, deep conversations under the stars, or just being somewhere scenic and peaceful with the right person. I also enjoy staying in and watching movies and getting comfy and cozy with the right person, or drinking wine in a hot tub under the stars. 

No matter what, an ideal night has to have the right person or people around. I have low energy if I’m around the wrong people no matter what, but I usually do not do that since I surround myself with people that keep me energized and engaged and ready to have fun.","My perfect date is the kind of night where there’s chemistry, fun, deep conversation, and the feeling that time doesn’t exist. Like everything just clicks effortlessly with that person.  A perfect date isn’t about the activity, it’s about the energy between us. If we can turn something simple into something unforgettable, that’s when you know it’s real. We could be in the Tuscan vineyards on a sunny evening sipping wine, or in the middle of the O-block on a cloudy foggy day, but being with the right person with the right energy makes it matter the most to me.","I don’t know anyone doing this so far, so idk yet","I don’t like to ask generic “getting to know you” questions. I ask things that actually make people think. Here are some of my go-to questions: 	1. “What’s something about you that most people don’t notice right away?” (Shows if she has depth and isn’t boring) 	2. “If you could live anywhere in the world for a year, where would it be and why?” (Shows their curiosity and ambition) 	3. “What’s a non-negotiable in your life: something you refuse to settle on?” (Can signal their standards and values.)  4. “What’s one moment in your life that completely changed you?” (Opens the door for real, meaningful conversation.)

I have many spiritual beliefs that are my own unique ones and don’t fully align with Christianity or any religion in existence 100%.,4,open,"I’m very picky and maybe shallow about looks. I view myself as a high value person and want someone on that same level. It sounds arrogant, fine, but if I don’t view the girl as the same level, there’s no attraction. And personality ofc matters too.","I’m driven, confident, and always seeking to level up in every area of life—physically, mentally, socially. I naturally have a strong presence, and people tend to notice me before I even say a word. But beyond that, I’m grounded, intentional, and selective with who I let into my life.  I’m passionate about fitness, aesthetics, and self-improvement, but I also value deep, raw, real connections with people. I’m the kind of person who will go all in for the people who matter, but I also have high standards. I live by the mindset that if you’re in my life, you’re here because you add value, and I’ll do the same for you.  Also—I’m definitely the guy who can hold an intense, deep conversation, but I also know how to keep things fun, sarcastic, and light when the moment calls for it. Balance is key","My ideal partner is a girl who has a strong feminine energy, but she’s also intelligent, ambitious, and can hold a real conversation. Someone who is confident, carries herself well, and doesn’t settle for mediocrity in any area of life.

She knows how to match my energy, whether that’s bantering back and forth, keeping things playful, or having deep conversations about real things. She’s warm, engaging, and has depth, not just surface-level attractiveness.

I also would like someone who can fit into my frame and is okay with me taking the initiative and leading. Someone who knows how much I value her and her input but who is okay letting go and feeling safe and comfortable around me enough to let me give her my world and make her happy.","Physically, I’m drawn to Italian or Mediterranean-looking women. Darker, natural hair, and warm, balanced features. But beyond looks, I fall for girls who are genuinely engaging, playful, and ambitious and driven just like me: someone who makes me feel like I need to bring my best to the table and has high expectations for themselves too.",,,,,,,,,,,Often,Rarely,Never,Never,Rarely,Always,Sometimes,Pmelitski7@gmail.com,4,,,,VERY important.,VERY important.,I do not care.,It matters to me.,Sometimes,,,,,,No,"Moderate, Conservative",Never,Often,Never,Never,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rarely,Rarely,Never,Never,Rarely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Often,,Never,,,Never,Sometimes,Often,Sometimes,Often,Never,Often,Often,Never,Rarely,Never,Never,Often,Never,Never,Never,Rarely,Never,Never,Rarely,Rarely,Sometimes,Sometimes,Never,Rarely,Rarely,Rarely,Never,Rarely,Never,Often,Always,Sometimes,Sometimes,Sometimes,"Listened to D.A.R.E., Tried a drug but only once or twice, Weed",Zelle,,Through Tyler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gentleman, ensconced within his chamber, is attended by his valet, a paragon of discretion and efficiency. The valet, with hands as deft as those of a surgeon, assists his master into a tailcoat of the finest black broadcloth, its lapels gleaming with the subtle sheen of silk. The waistcoat, a masterpiece of embroidered brocade, is fastened with buttons of polished jet, while the cravat—oh, the cravat!—is tied with mathematical precision into a waterfall knot, its snowy whiteness a stark contrast to the somber hues of the ensemble. The gentleman’s trousers, tailored to an exactitude that would make a Savile Row artisan weep with pride, are held in place by braces of the sturdiest leather, and his boots, polished to a mirror-like finish, click softly against the floorboards as he descends the grand staircase.

Meanwhile, the lady of the house, in her boudoir, is undergoing her own transformation. Her lady’s maid, a creature of infinite patience and skill, laces her into a corset of such formidable construction that it might well double as a suit of armor. Over this foundation of whalebone and determination, the maid layers a crinoline of vast circumference, its steel hoops whispering like the rustle of distant forests. The gown itself, a confection of silk and satin, is adorned with ruching, flounces, and enough ribbons to festoon a Maypole. The décolletage, daring yet demure, is framed by a fichu of lace, while the sleeves, puffed and beribboned, taper to a tight fit at the wrist. Her hair, an elaborate edifice of curls and braids, is crowned with a diadem of pearls, and her gloves, reaching nearly to her elbows, are of the softest kid leather. A fan, intricately painted with scenes of pastoral idyll, dangles from her wrist, and a reticule, containing a handkerchief embroidered with her initials, hangs from her arm.

Thus attired, the household gathers in the drawing room, a space so richly appointed as to verge on the oppressive. The walls are hung with damask of a deep crimson, their surfaces interrupted at intervals by oil paintings in heavy gilt frames. The furniture, upholstered in velvet and brocade, is arranged with geometric precision around a hearth of carved marble, within which a fire crackles merrily. The gasolier, its crystal pendants refracting the light into a thousand prismatic shards, casts a warm glow over the scene, while the air is perfumed with the scent of beeswax polish and hothouse flowers.

Dinner, served in the dining room, is a symphony of excess. The table, draped in damask and set with silver and china, groans beneath the weight of countless courses. There is turtle soup, its richness a testament to the chef’s skill; there are oysters, their briny succulence a nod to the sea’s bounty. A roast of beef, pink at its heart and encased in a crust of herbs, is carved with ceremonial solemnity, while side dishes of vegetables, each more elaborately sauced than the last, are passed with murmured compliments. The wines, decanted into cut-glass vessels, are poured with a reverence befitting their vintage, and the conversation, though constrained by the dictates of etiquette, is punctuated by the occasional witticism or bon mot.

Following dinner, the ladies retire to the drawing room, leaving the gentlemen to their port and cigars. The air grows thick with the aroma of tobacco and the murmur of masculine discourse, while in the drawing room, the ladies engage in genteel pursuits: the tinkling of a pianoforte, the rustle of embroidery silks, the soft flutter of fans. When the gentlemen rejoin them, the evening reaches its apogee with music and dancing. The lady of the house seats herself at the pianoforte, her fingers flying over the keys with practiced ease, while the guests form sets for a quadrille or a waltz. The gentlemen, their faces flushed with exertion and good cheer, bow with exaggerated gallantry, while the ladies, their skirts swirling like the petals of some exotic bloom, curtsy with equal grace.

As the clock strikes the hour, the guests begin to take their leave, their carriages drawing up to the door with a clatter of hooves and a jingle of harness. The host and hostess, standing in the doorway, bid their farewells with expressions of regret and promises of future gatherings. The house, now silent save for the ticking of the hall clock and the occasional pop of the dying fire, settles into repose, its inhabitants retiring to their chambers with the satisfaction of a night well spent. (as one """"""""""""""""person"""""""""""""""" would say)","""Seven. A.M. Case the restaurant, run background checks on the staff. Can the cook be trusted? If not I got to kill him. Dispose of the body, replace him with my own guy, no later than 4:30.""",⢻⢭⡓⣆⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠸⣏⢖⡲⣅⠀⠀ ⣣⢾⡛⣜⢫⣦⠀⠀⢀⣤⠴⡦⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⣸⢏⡝⣆⢀ ⢿⣧⢹⣬⡷⣚⣒⣶⡾⣍⡞⡱⣞⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣠⢤⠖⣦⡤⠤⡶⠦⠤⣤⢶⠲⠤⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡤⠶⢶⢤⡀⢸⣛⣮⢞⡜⡚ ⠈⡷⣻⢏⠶⣙⢶⣼⠟⡼⣜⡵⠋⠀⠀⠀⣠⠞⡩⢴⣿⣿⣾⣹⠐⢢⢁⡾⡵⠚⢻⣷⣤⡙⠲⢄⠀⠀⢾⣍⡻⣌⢧⣷⡾⡞⣥⢫⡝⣃ ⠀⢻⣿⢊⣟⣾⢫⢇⡻⣱⢺⠁⠀⠀⠀⡼⣡⣿⣄⣀⡿⣿⣿⡏⡇⢢⢸⡿⣷⣤⣼⠿⢿⣿⣷⣎⣷⠀⠈⠳⣵⡩⢖⡻⣱⢻⣌⡳⢎⡵ ⠀⠀⢻⡧⢞⡧⣋⣮⣕⡣⢿⠀⠀⢀⡼⢃⣻⢿⣿⣿⣧⠾⠟⡙⣧⣂⣌⢣⡛⡿⠿⠷⠾⠿⠿⠣⣌⠳⡀⢰⢯⡱⣫⡶⢥⣛⢮⡓⣏⢶ ⠀⠀⠈⢯⡧⣓⢧⡚⣽⣞⡾⠀⢀⡞⠠⣿⠀⡰⢂⣖⣤⣯⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⠄⣎⣱⣉⢎⡱⣘⡇⠹⡞⣮⢵⢯⣱⠳⡬⢧⡙⣦⠋ ⠀⠀⠀⠈⠳⣭⢲⡹⢲⡞⠁⠀⣼⢐⠡⡙⠳⠗⡛⣩⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣯⡁⡉⠛⣶⣵⠋⡐⢿⠈⠻⣆⢧⡛⢜⣣⠟⠁⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⢰⡇⢊⠔⡡⢊⠔⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡈⠡⣿⢹⡄⢡⢚⣇⠀⠈⠉⠉⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡇⢊⠤⢑⠢⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣧⢹⠃⢢⢻⡄⢊⣏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣇⠌⢢⠁⢎⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠟⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣏⡄⢣⢺⡇⢼⡋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢻⡊⠤⠉⢼⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠋⡄⠒⡌⢢⠐⡌⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣯⠛⢓⠛⣠⡾⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢧⡘⡏⣿⣿⣿⡿⠋⡄⠣⠌⡱⢈⠄⢣⠐⡡⠘⢿⣿⣿⣿⡐⣌⢒⣰⠏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢳⡅⠸⠿⢛⡡⠘⡄⠣⡘⠄⠣⡘⠄⢣⠐⣉⠂⠻⢿⠿⠁⢼⡲⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢧⣁⠦⠟⡁⢣⠐⡡⠂⡍⠰⢁⠎⡄⠣⢄⡉⠲⢦⣂⣉⢴⠗⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠙⢲⢥⣂⠅⣂⠑⡈⢅⠊⡐⠌⢡⢂⣌⣡⠶⣛⣙⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀,"would you rather take a pill that gives you the ability to turn your arms into any shape and material, or a pill that allows you to add 2 to anything ",no,yes,I like my oxygen pure,,Just oxygen,"No, I listened to D.A.R.E.",,7,2,5,3,7,3,4,4,6,5,5,5,6,1,1,2,4,5,5,7,5,7,6,Moderate,"Agnostic, I guess I dont really think about it ",4,open,"why is it called it a oven when you of in the cold food, but out hot eat the food???????","silly little guy, literal scrimblo ",using English ,liberal arts/ psychology majors (derogatory),,,,,,,,,,,Always,Sometimes,Always,Rarely,Often,Often,Always,mjt0063@auburn.edu,5,,,,It matters to me.,VERY important.,VERY important.,I do not care.,Always,,,,,,No,"Liberal, Conservative",Sometimes,Often,Always,Always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sometimes,Always,Often,Always,Always,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Often,,Rarely,,,Sometimes,Often,Always,Often,Sometimes,Always,Often,Sometimes,Always,Always,Never,Never,Rarely,Never,Often,Often,Never,Rarely,Never,Often,Rarely,Always,Never,Never,Never,Never,Often,Never,Never,Sometimes,Never,Never,Rarely,Often,Always,"Listened to D.A.R.E., Tried a drug but only once or twice",Cash,,Flyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
